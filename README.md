# Analysis-of-Global-Cyber-Threats-Between-2015-and-2024
In an increasingly digital world, the frequency, complexity, and cost of cyberattacks have grown exponentially. The Global Cybersecurity Threats Dataset (2015–2024) offers a decade-long lens into the nature of these threats—across industries, countries, and technologies. 

About the Dataset
The Global Cybersecurity Threats Dataset offers a comprehensive view of cyberattacks, malware, and vulnerabilities across the globe from 2015 to 2024. It spans various industries such as healthcare, finance, government, IT, education, and more. This dataset enables the analysis of attack trends, industry-specific threats, geographic risk profiles, and the effectiveness of defense mechanisms.

Story Behind the Data
The purpose of analyzing this dataset is to uncover:
How financial losses correlate with attack types.
Which industries are most targeted and why.
Country and attack source mapping to identify geopolitical or economic triggers.
Defense mechanism effectiveness on resolution time and financial damage.
Temporal trends of attacks—how types evolve over time.
Human cost via affected users and insider threats.
Forecasting cyber threats to identify high-risk industries/countries.
Temporal evolution of losses and the most devastating incidents.
Vulnerability patterns by country, and the changing landscape of cyber defense.
The role of swift response in mitigating losses.

Key Research Questions
General Questions
What are the most common types of cyberattacks?
Which industries are most vulnerable to cyberattacks?
What are the top countries affected by cyberattacks?
What is the average financial loss per cyberattack?
How many users are affected by cyberattacks on average?

Attack-Specific Questions
What are the most common attack vectors (e.g., phishing, ransomware, DDoS)?
Which malware types are most prevalent?
What vulnerabilities are most exploited?
How do attackers gain access to systems or data?
What defense mechanisms are commonly used?

Industry-Specific Questions
Which industries face particular attack types (e.g., healthcare and ransomware)?
What challenges are unique to each industry?
How do industries recover from attacks?

Geographic Questions
Which countries report the most attacks?
What are the dominant attack types by region?
How do national responses vary?

Temporal Questions
How have attack patterns changed from 2015–2024?
Are there seasonal/periodic attack trends?
How has the efficiency of defense mechanisms evolved?

Correlation/Causality Questions
Is there a link between attack volume and financial loss?
Do specific attack vectors lead to higher user impact?
Does faster resolution time correlate with reduced financial damage?

Key Observations (2015–2024)
Top Countries Affected:
UK (321), Brazil (310), India (308), France/Japan (305) are most affected.
The narrow range (281–321) indicates widespread global targeting.

Yearly Trends:
2017 had the highest attacks (319), followed by 2022 (318) and 2020/2023 (315).
2019 recorded the lowest incidents (263).

Industry Vulnerability:
IT (478 attacks) and Banking (445) are top targets—due to valuable data and system interconnectivity.
Healthcare (429) is also high, linked to legacy systems and patient data risks.

Financial Losses by Industry (Average):
IT: $24.8M, Banking: $22.7M, Government: $21.2M, Retail: $21.1M.
Education and Telecom show relatively lower losses but still face data theft and service disruption.

Users Affected by Attack Types:
DDoS: 265.2M victims, SQL Injection: 257.8M, Phishing: 257.7M, Ransomware: 247.9M.

Attack Frequency:
DDoS (531) and Phishing (529) are most frequent—highlighting automated botnets and social engineering.

Effective Defense Mechanisms:
Antivirus (628) and VPN (612) have high success rates—reflecting widespread adoption.

Recommendations
Improve Infrastructure in High-Risk Regions:
Invest in AI-based threat detection for UK, Brazil, India.
Enforce regulatory frameworks (GDPR, NIST).
Investigate 2017 Attack Spike:
Examine causes (e.g., major breaches, geopolitical events) to learn from anomalies.

Prioritize High-Risk Industries (IT & Banking):
Adopt zero-trust models, AI-driven detection, and cyber insurance.
In Healthcare, mandate data encryption and audit legacy systems.

Tactical Defense for Attack Types:
DDoS: Use cloud-based mitigation (e.g., traffic scrubbing, rate limiting).
SQL Injection: Apply input validation and parameterized queries.
Phishing: Enable DMARC/SPF/DKIM, conduct employee training.

Layered Security Approach:
Combine Antivirus (endpoint) + Firewall (network) + Encryption (data).
Ensure redundancy for critical systems to reduce downtime.

Conclusion

This decade-long analysis underscores the escalating and evolving nature of global cyber threats. Both developed and developing nations face increasingly sophisticated attacks targeting high-value data and systems. Defense strategies must evolve through data-driven insights, AI-enhanced tools, policy reform, and industry-specific interventions.

By understanding patterns and weaknesses, organizations and governments can prioritize investments and create resilient cybersecurity infrastructures capable of combating modern threats.
